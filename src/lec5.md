## Support Vector Machine

- margin is the closet point to the decision boundary
- we want to try to make the "band" as big as possible without hitting the data points(TODO: figure)
- "support vectors": data points on the margin

### To compute the margin width

- let vector $w$ to be perpendicular to the boundary
- so like we try to maximum the width wich is $\sum_j w^2_j$
