# Neural Network

## Multi-layer Perceptron(aka Neural Network)

if we can merge the output of the perceptrons and feed it into another perceptron, we can separate complex data like this(TODO: figure).

- treat the output of a perceptron with a non-linear function(step function) to prevent the final result being linear
- features are outputs of an perceptron
- multi-class classifiers can share underlying parameters

## Dropout

- zero out some random in every iteration
- encourages? overfitting
