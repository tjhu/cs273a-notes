# Terminologies

* covariance: how much two random variables vary together.
* datum: data point.
* exampler-based model: save the examples and make predictions based on the samples.
* joint probability: probability of $A$ and $B$, aka $p(A ∩ B)$.
* variance: variance of a single variable $\sigma^2_x = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i – \bar{x})^2 \\$.
